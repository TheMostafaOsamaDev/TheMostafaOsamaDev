# 💫 About Me:
I'm a computer science graduate with a knack for building applications from the ground up. I thrive in the full-stack world, where I can leverage the power of technologies like NestJS, NextJS, ReactJS, and Express to craft robust application. Worked with DB systems SQL Server, MySQL or MongoDB.<br>
